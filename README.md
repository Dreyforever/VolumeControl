# Volume Control Using Hand Gestures
This is a Computer Vision project which involves controlling the volume of your computer using hand gestures. The HandTrackingModule detects the hands that are present in the video and maps the distance between the tip of the thumb and the index finger. The volume is changed proportional to this distance. To increase the volume increase the distance between the two fingers and vice versa.

The required modules for the proper working of the code are: Opencv-python, Mediapipe
Also ensure that the HandTrackingModule is in the same folder as the main.py file, as we are importing this module in the main file
